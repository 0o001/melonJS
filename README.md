# melonJS Live Examples and Documentation

This branch contains the melonJS examples and documentation. It is generated automatically with the following command (executed on the `master` branch):

```bash
grunt gh-pages
```

The `gh-pages` task is also done as part of the `release` task, used for deploying a new build.
