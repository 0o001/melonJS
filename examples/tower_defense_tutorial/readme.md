# Oregon State Course 497 Capstone Project
Tower Defense Program Using MelonJS

-------------
This Tutorial is a work in progress.
The goal of this Tutorial to provide the simple staged parts of the Capstone 
project as tutorials so that others who are first starting to learn 
the MelonJS framwork can have a starting point to understand and the learn 
how to use MelonJS.  Hopefully when the series is finished
there will be a simple 3 level Tower Defense program that can be 
somewhat functional.

Included So Far is the First Tutorial in the Series and An Overview 
of how MelonJS is implemented.

These tutorials will focus on usage of the Framework and not the development
of the framework. While these concepts are closely related because
if you source the MelonJS.js file as the non minified version
you can have access to the human readable objects, which can go a long
way to understanding how the framework works.

I would expect that once you start on the path of these tutorials
at some point you will want to break from them and go straight to
the other examples in this directory that more clearly illustrate
different key components once you start developing your own content.
