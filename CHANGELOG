Version History 
---------------
0.9.1
* General: fixed compatibility issues with IE9/10
* Core: "cache image" option (disabled by default) to use canvas instead of directly using Image Object
* Core: add onPause and onResume callback when game is paused/resumed on losing/gaining focus
* Core: added possibility to pass more than 1 extra argument to me.state.change (extra arguments will be passed to the reset function of the target object)
* Core: object can now only be destroyed using me.game.remove(obj), made of ObjectEntity.destroy a private function
* TMX: implemented Tiled "transparency" property for Tileset, allowing to specify which color should be transparent (note: this slows down level loading)
* TMX: fixed unnecessary canvas creation for the collision layer (should free some memory)
* TMX: cleaned/optimized data loading and fixed an issue on FF with XML parsing of "big" Base64 encoded maps (only first nodeValue was parsed by the engine)
* TMX: added support for CSV data encoding
* TMX: added support for flipped tiles, as supported in Tiled 7.0
* Entity: merge AnimatedSpriteObject into SpriteObject. SpriteObject now takes an optional additional argument to create an animated sprite
* Viewport: fixed camera refresh when changing "deadzone" values
* loader: added a "onProgress" callback to get progress notification, removing the need to poll the loader each frame for loading progress
* loader: fix progress notification when TMX files are loaded into the levelDirector
* loader: added a retry counter for the audio loading : script will now stop and throw an exception after 3 unsuccessful loading attempts.
* video: renamed "applyEffect" to "applyRGBFilter", and fixed an issue on Opera
* geometry : added a merge function to me.Rect

0.9.0

* Geometry: define getter for me.Rect coordinates (simplify code)
* Level: support for fadeOut/fadeIn effect in me.LevelEntity (when changing levels)

* Entity: makes SpriteObjet inherit from me.Rect (make it easier to manage sprite pos and size)
* Loader: cosmetic update of the preloader screen
* Viewport: "rounding" issue fix in the viewportEntity (~~30% less CPU usage on Safari/OSX!)

0.8.0
* TMX: support for "TiledObject" (as supported in Tiled 0.6.2)
* Entity: re-factored constructor call to Object Entities (to use the settings obj produced through Tiled)

* Viewport: re-factored and fixed the camera/viewport code
