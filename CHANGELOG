0.9.1
* Core: "cache image" option (disabled by default) to use canvas instead of directly using Image Object
* Core: add onPause and onResume callback when game is paused/resumed on losing/gaining focus
* Core: added possibility to pass more than 1 extra argument to me.state.change (extra arguments will be passed to the reset function of the target object)

* Core: experimental webGL wrapper

* Core: improved the requestAnimFrame usage, and fallback to setInterval. me.sys.useNativeAnimFrame to enable it (disable by default)
* Core: optimized the way objects are managed in the game loop
* Core: defined (and used) a Object.defineProperty function to replace __defineGetter__ / __defineSetter__ (was not supported on IE9/IE10) 
* TMX: implemented Tiled "transparency" property for Tileset, allowing to specify which color should be transparent (note: this slows down level loading)
* TMX: fixed unnecessary canvas creation for the collision layer (should free some memory)
* TMX: cleaned/optimized data loading and fixed an issue on FF with XML parsing of "big" Base64 encoded maps (only first nodeValue was parsed by the engine)

* loader: fix progress notification when TMX files are loaded into the levelDirector
* loader: added a retry counter for the audio loading : script will now stop and throw an exception after 3 unsuccessful loading attempts.
* video: renamed "applyEffect" to "applyRGBFilter", and fixed an issue on Opera
* audio: fixed compatibility issues with IE9/10
* geometry : added a merge function to me.Rect

0.9.0

* Level: support for fadeOut/fadeIn effect in me.LevelEntity (when changing levels)
* Entity: correctly implemented InvisibleEntity Objects (no longer inherit from ObjectEntity)
* Entity: makes SpriteObjet inherit from me.Rect (make it easier to manage sprite pos and size)
* Loader: cosmetic update of the preloader screen
* Viewport: "rounding" issue fix in the viewportEntity (~~30% less CPU usage on Safari/OSX!)
* TMX: cleaned & refactored tilemap collision detection (still not perfect though)

0.8.0
